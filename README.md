- CMake 3.15+
- Make or Ninja build system

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/riteshr19/GPU-Architecture-Simulator-Enhancement.git
cd GPU-Architecture-Simulator-Enhancement

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

#include "memory_hierarchy.h"
#include "texture_cache.h"

// Initialize components
auto memory = std::make_shared<MemoryHierarchy>();
auto gpu_core = std::make_shared<GPUCore>(32);  // 32 shader cores
auto texture_cache = std::make_shared<TextureCache>(256);  // 256MB cache

// Enable advanced features
texture_cache->enable_smart_prefetching(true);
texture_cache->enable_adaptive_caching(true);

// Initialize the system
gpu_core->initialize(memory, perf_monitor);
texture_cache->initialize(memory, perf_monitor);
